# AutoAds
Automate ad rewards with this simple Node.js app. Nearly undetectable but use at your own risk. 


## Work in progress

This uses puppeteer, an automation library that works on top of Chrome/Chromium browsers.

## Requirements

- A (preferably latest) version of Chrome of other Chromium browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera etc.
This will *not* work on Safari or Firefox. 
- A Windows machine. Support will be added for MacOS/Linux later. 
- Half a brain cell and the ability to follow instructions. 

NOTE: if you are using the basic Chromium, it may not be able to play back video.
