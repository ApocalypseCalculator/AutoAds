# Usage Guide

Before we get started, make sure you fulfil all the requirements listed in the README. 

First, install the latest release from [the releases tab](https://github.com/Orbis-Software-Services/AutoAds/releases).
Make sure you download the autoads.zip and not the source code zip. 

After downloading, unzip it to an easily accessible location. 

If you have knowledge of how to use a terminal, you can run `autoads.exe` as a CLI app. 

Otherwise, simply double click on the executable.

If AutoAds cannot find your default Chromium installation, you will be prompted to find the Chromium executable using a File Explorer window. 

Find the executable (either chrome.exe, msedge.exe, etc.) and select it. AutoAds will take it from there.
