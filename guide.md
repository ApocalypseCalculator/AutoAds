# Usage Guide

Before we get started, make sure you fulfil all the requirements listed in the README. 

First, install the latest release from [the releases tab](https://github.com/Orbis-Software-Services/AutoAds/releases).
Make sure you download the autoads.zip and not the source code zip

After downloading, unzip it to an easily accessible location. Do not immediately click on the exe file.

Open a terminal on your desktop. If you don't know what I'm talking about, go to your Windows search bar 
and type in `cmd`. `Command Prompt` should show up as an option. Click on it and you'll be greeted with a simple 
interface. 

Using the `cd` command, navigate to your folder containing the .exe file you just downloaded.

E.g. if my .exe file was in `C:/Users/myusername/Desktop/autoads/` then I would do
```
cd C:/Users/myusername/Desktop/autoads/
```
Then run the command
```
autoads --start
```
If you use powershell it would be `./autoads --start`

If this is your first time, you'll get a file selection dialog prompting you to find a chromium executable.

Find the executable (either chrome.exe, msedge.exe, etc.) and select it. AutoAds will take it from there.
